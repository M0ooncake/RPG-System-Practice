# RPG-System-Practice
# What is this project?
This Project was advised to me by one of my class 
instructors to help significantly boost my
programming skills. 
Already I've learned a great deal.
* Be advised that this is under active development and all is subject to change

## Progress Log
* [Progress Log File](./RPG System Practice/SupportingDocuments/ProgressLog.md)
# The goal
Ideally, by building a simple RPG system backend I will
learn ways to better share information back and forth between
various systems/scripts. Structs especially have been lacking
in recent project, mainly because I never tried to use them.
